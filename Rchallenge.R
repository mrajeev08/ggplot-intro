# Part 1: ggplot in R ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Read in the RxP.csv data from the first day (1 pt)


# Plot the means of the final snout to vent length (SVL.final)
# by the type of predator treatment (pred) (1 pt)


# Add in the resource variable using color (1 pt)


# Extra credit: **draw** a plot that would show the results of your study! (2 pts)


# Part 2: thinking through age and infection ----------------------------------------------------

# Plot the relationship between the force of infection (range between 0.01 - 5) and 
# the average age of infection (1 pt)
# Hint: the average age of infection = 1/the force of infection


# Plot the relationship between R0 (range between 1 - 20) and the average age of infection 
# if life expectancy at birth is 60 years. (1 pt)
# Hint: the average age of infection = 1/the force of infection
# and R0 = the force of infection*life expectancy
