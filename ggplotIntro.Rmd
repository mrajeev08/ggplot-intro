```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, out.width = "55%")
```

## Why vizualize data?
1. To explore relationships in our data
2. To communicate/present what we found

```{r  out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("figs/nightengale.jpg")
```

## Why ggplot?
- Easy to quickly generate plots which can help us do # 1
- Flexible and good defaults which help us with # 2

## Packages we need
```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
# install.packages("ggplot2")
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library(ggplot2)
```

## The basics of the ggplot = the dataframe
- Classic R dataset
```{r}
head(iris)
```

## The basics of the ggplot = the dataframe
- A dataframe where each row corresponds to a record ('wide format') and variables are columns
```{r}
ggplot(data = iris)
```
  
  **Creates a blank plot. We need to decide what variables we want to plot.**

## The basics of the ggplot = the aes
- aes = the aesthetics.
```{r}
head(iris)
```
  
  **Let's look at the relationship between the variables Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width.**

## The basics of the ggplot = the aes
- aes = the aesthetics (what we want to plot)
```{r}
## Let's try the Sepal.Length vs. the Sepal.Width (x, y plot)
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) 
```
  
  **Still blank! We need to decide what kind of plot to use.**

## How do we figure out what kind of plot to use?
**We need to think about how best to visualize this data.**
```{r}
summary(iris)
```

## How do we figure out what kind of plot to use?
**We need to think about what we want to show.**

Quick excercise: try drawing with pen and paper what you think these plots might look like: 
  
  
- Relationship between Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width 
- Distribution of Petal.Length
- Comparing the means of Sepal.Length by Species

- Distribution of Petal.Length
- Comparing the means of Sepal.Length by Species

**Hint** 
Here are the options: Histogram - XY Scatter plot - Boxplot.

## The basics of ggplot = the geom
- Geom = geometry 
  
- The 'geom_' functions choose what kind of graph we want to show:
  - **geom_point (point graphs, xy relationships)**
  - **geom_histogram (distribution of a continuous variable)**
  - **geom_boxplot (comparing means of groups)**
  - geom_col/geom_bar
  - geom_line (timeseries)
  - geom_tile (heatmaps)
  - geom_polygon (mapping)


## geom_point: XY Relationship
```{r}
## add the geom that we want
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point()
```
  
**Is there anything you notice?**

## Adding other aesthetics to help visualize potential relationships
**Using color, we want to differentiate the points by species.**
```{r}
## 
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```
  
## Adding other aesthetics to help visualize potential relationships
- The common aesthetics you can add:
  - color 
  - fill 
  - shape
  - linewidth
  - alpha (transparency)

## Adding other aesthetics to help visualize potential relationships
**Now try it with shape and fill.**
```{r}
## 
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, shape = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```
  
  **Need to trouble shoot a bit to see what the best option is for a given geom.**

## Specifying things within vs. outside the aes
- Outside aes
```{r}
## try it outside
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), color = Species) +
  geom_point()
```

## Specifying things within vs. outside the aes
- As part of geom
```{r}
## add it to the geom 
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point(color = "red")

```

## Specifying things within vs. outside the aes
- Inside aes = the way to specify an aesthetic by a variable in the dataframe.
```{r}
## 
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, 
                        y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```
  
  **Try playing around with the aesthetics and see what you get!**

## Going a bit further: comparing means
```{r}
## 
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, 
                        y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
  
  - boxplots visualize the mean (in ggplot, also the 25 and 75% quantiles and any points outside of those--considered outliers)

##  Going a bit further: distributions
```{r}
## The histogram
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
  
**Play around with the binwidth option to see what the best bin is**. 

##  Going a bit further: distributions by categorical variable
```{r}
## The histogram
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25)
```

##  Going a bit further: distributions by categorical variable
```{r}
## The density plot
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_density()
```

## Going a bit further: creating multiple plots with facetting
- If we want to split this plot by species to make it easier to see the distributions
```{r}
## By fill
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25)
```

## Going a bit further: creating multiple plots with facetting
```{r}
## By facetting
ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25) +
  facet_wrap(~ Species)
```

## Customizing our ggplot
- We'll save our ggplot as an object called base.
  
```{r}
base <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Customizing: labels
- Then we can change specific components of it by adding customizations. 
  
```{r}
base +
  xlab("Sepal Length") +
  ylab("Sepal Width")
```

## Customizing: color scales
```{r}
base +
  xlab("Sepal Length") +
  ylab("Sepal Width") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("purple", "blue", "lightblue"), name = "Species of Iris")
```

## Customizing: color scales
  - The scale_ functions help us specify what colors we want to use
    - scale_fill_gradient
    - scale_fill_continuous
  - The viridis color scales are a good option to try for continuous variables! (scale_fill_viridis)
  
## Customizing: themes
```{r}
base +
  theme_bw()
```
  
  **Try theme_dark and theme_classic.**

## Saving our plots
```{r}
base <- ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  xlab("Sepal Length") +
  ylab("Sepal Width") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("purple", "blue", "pink"), name = "Species of Iris") +
  theme_bw()

ggsave("base_plot.pdf", base, device = "pdf")
```

## Customizing...the options are almost unlimited!
- For most of the routine things you need to do, there is a way. To figure it out your best friend is stack exchange and the ggplot documentation!

## Other considerations: communicating accurately and effectively
- Anscombe's quartet
  - Identical means, variance, and correlation, but when you plot it you see the differences.
```{r  out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("figs/anscombe.png")
```

## Other considerations: communicating accurately and effectively
- Scales of axes: should they include zero?
```{r  out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='left'}
include_graphics("figs/axes_nozero.gif")
```

## Other considerations: communicating accurately and effectively
- Scales of axes: should they include zero?
```{r  out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='left'}
include_graphics("figs/axes_woutzero.png")
```

## Other considerations: communicating accurately and effectively
- Scales of axes: should they include zero?
```{r  out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='left'}
include_graphics("figs/axes_shouldzero.png")
```

## Other considerations: communicating accurately and effectively
- Scales of axes: should they include zero?
```{r  out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='left'}
include_graphics("figs/axes_shouldnozero.jpeg")
```

## Excercises
- Using the RxP data, plot:
  - The distribution of Snout-vent length at emergence (SVL.initial)
  - The correlation between Snout-vent length at emergence and at the end of the experiment (SVL.initial and SVL.final)
  - The mean of SVL.final by Res 
  - The mean of SVL.final by Pred
  - Advanced: the mean difference between final and initial SVL for Res and Pred
